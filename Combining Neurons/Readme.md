At this stage I've tried to combine different sorts of neurons to see which combination helps the most with the shadow extraction
See results in pdf

Some of them are shown here:

As shown by the experimental results, combinations of A and B channel single opponency and A-channel single and B-channel double opponency are the most contrast ones, and we probably can use them to extract shadows
