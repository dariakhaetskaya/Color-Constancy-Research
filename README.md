 - Problem: Modern convolutional neural networks strongly depend on the training sample and illumination of the scenes. There is a strong need for the maintenance of resistance to light changes.
- Ways of solving the problem: Use of bio-inspired neural networks for simulating color constancy. Formation of receptive fields for segmentation purposes.
- Applications: 
	- Improving the performance of modern computer vision systems
	- Video analytics systems
	- Robotics
